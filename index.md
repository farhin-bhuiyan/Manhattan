## Manhattan

## Introduction

## Borough Overview

The bar graph above depicts the average area of sidewalk space the restaurants in each borough have access to, which was achieved using the mean() function to the Sidewalk Dimensions (Area) column. The Bronx is the borough with the most sidewalk area for outdoor seating with nearly 500 square feet of sidewalk space total, while Manhattan is the borough with the least amount of sidewalk area available, with about only 300 square feet accessible. The lack of outdoor seating space that Manhattan holds is one of the borough’s chief obstacles when it comes to reopening restaurants. Manhattan is the smallest borough in NYC while also being the most densely populated (with about 72,000 people per square mile), so the infrastructure of the roads is often built to be narrow as the area is usually more closed in. In neighborhoods like the West Village and Midtown, the narrow streets make social distancing when outdoor dining much more difficult, which goes against the CDC protocols. When conducting outdoor seating on sidewalks, tables and chairs cannot exceed the business’ frontage width. This proved to be difficult for many restaurants as many Manhattan restaurants cannot be very wide due to the cramped nature of the city.

The above bar graph shows the amount of restaurants in each borough that are approved for sidewalk seating, approved for roadway seating, and are approved for both. Manhattan is the borough with the most restaurants approved for sidewalk seating (with about 2,000 restaurants), the most restaurants approved for roadway seating (with about 1,000 restaurants), and thus the borough with the highest number of restaurants approved for outdoor seating (a bit over 3,000 restaurants). The value_counts() function was utilized to compare the number of restaurants approved for different types of seating in each borough. Manhattan also has the most open streets available even after taking roadway and sidewalk seating into account. While Manhattan has the least opportunities to open up outdoor seating in comparison to the other boroughs (because of its small area and high population), the restaurants of the borough still grab at every opportunity to reopen, leading it to have the most restaurants approved for sidewalk and roadway seating. This approval means that the restaurants are not obstructing bus stops, no standing/no stopping anytime zones, doorways, or FDNY access, and also do not disrupt traffic within the city. With this in mind, social distancing measures may not always be fully taken into account given the packed population of Manhattan in such limited space, even outdoors, which is worth taking note of as well. While health measures should be strictly followed to ensure a healthy dining experience, tables may be set closer together in outdoor dining spaces in Manhattan to make use of the very limited space (with this authorization given to vaccinated customers).
